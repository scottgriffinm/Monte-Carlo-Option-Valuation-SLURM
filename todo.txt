o try far-itm, itm, atm, otm, far otm
    - at what number of simulations does each simulation result match BS to 2 decimal places

o time differences at different simulation sizes

o pregenerate random numbers


Time comparisons by simulation sizes, each matching BS to different decimal places.


Simulation sizes:
    a -> match BS to dollar amount = 800 simulations
    b -> match BS to one decimal place
    c -> match BS to two decimal places
    d -> match BS to three decimal places
    e -> match BS to four decimal places
    f -> match BS to five decimal places
